QueueBot manages suggestion queueing and approval for the Google Emoji Discord guild.
It requires Python >=3.6 and the `discord.py@rewrite <https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite/>`__ library.

It is not recommended to run an instance of this bot yourself. The code is here primarily for reference and bugfixing.
